# Exploit Security Guidelines

These rules apply when developing or running CTF exploits.

## Scope Limitations

1. **Only target provided challenge infrastructure**
   - Never target systems outside the CTF scope
   - Verify target URL/IP before sending payloads
   - Use local testing first when possible

2. **No destructive actions**
   - Avoid DoS attacks unless explicitly required
   - Don't delete or corrupt challenge data
   - Preserve access for other participants

## Safe Practices

1. **Testing locally first**
   - Run exploits against local instances
   - Use Docker when available
   - Test payloads incrementally

2. **Handle credentials carefully**
   - Don't log or expose credentials
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Clear sensitive data after use

3. **Rate limiting**
   - Add delays between requests when bruteforcing
   - Respect server limits
   - Use threading responsibly

## Code Quality

1. **Exploit scripts should be**
   - Self-contained and reproducible
   - Well-commented with exploitation steps
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Avoid common pitfalls**
   - Check return values
   - Handle connection failures
   - Add timeouts to network operations

## Disclosure

1. **During CTF**
   - Don't share flags publicly
   - Report infrastructure issues to organizers
   - Follow CTF rules

2. **After CTF**
   - Write responsible writeups
   - Wait for embargo period if specified
   - Credit challenge authors
